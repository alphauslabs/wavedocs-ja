# Concepts and terms

## TrueUnblended

TrueUnblended is the term we use at Alphaus to refer to some of the corrective recalculations we do specific to AWS billing data in relation to how RI/SP discounts are applied. You can check [here](https://alphauslabs.github.io/docs/trueunblended/) to understand more what it is about.

## Billing group

Billing group is one of the main grouping mechanisms available in Ripple. With billing groups, you can group cloud accounts; linked/member accounts in AWS, subscription IDs in Azure, and project IDs in GCP. You can also create tag-based billing groups. As a cloud reseller, you calculate invoices at the billing group level. Your clients' WavePro access is also rooted at the billing group level, although WavePro also supports access at the [access group](#access-group) level. Most Ripple features center around the billing group.

## Access group

Access group is a collection of billing groups.
