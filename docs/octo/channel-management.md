# Channel Management

Receive alerts from Octo through three ways: **email**, **Slack**, and **MS Teams**. These channels can be used across your organization. We'll be discussing how to create channels on each type.

## Navigate to the Channel Management Tab

- Locate the gear or cog icon on the top right corner of the app header, just beside your profile picture. You will see a curation of tabs
- Under the the `NOTIFICATION` section, click `Channel Management`

## Creating a Channel

From here, you will see three cards which separate your channels per type. Click the `ADD CHANNEL` button and a popup dialogue box should appear.

### Slack

- Input a channel name to your Slack channel and click `SAVE`.
- This will take you to a new tab prompting you to select the Slack channel you want to connect to Octo.
- If you're not logged in yet, follow the prompt regarding logging in and you should be taken to the authorization page.
- To change workspaces, locate the drop-down menu on the top right corner and select your desired workspace.
- Click `Allow` and this should take you back to the previous tab.

### MS Teams

- First, go to your MS Teams' channel and create a webhook. You can refer how to do so [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet#create-an-incoming-webhook).
- Input a channel name to your Slack channel and click `NEXT`.
- Supply your MS Teams' channel's webhook and click `SAVE`.

### Email

- This is pretty straightforward. Just supply the channel name which could serve as a nickname or shorthand of your actual email.
- Click `NEXT` and supply your email address.
- Click `SAVE`.

## Editing a Channel

- Click the channel type card to expand the list of channels you have.
- Simply click the pen icon and supply the edits. This process should be similar to creating a channel.
- Click `SAVE`.

## Deleting a Channel

- Click the channel type card to expand the list of channels you have.
- Simply click the trash icon and you're good to go.

Once you've got your channels set up, you can use these in creating alerts.
