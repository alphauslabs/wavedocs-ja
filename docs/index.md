!!! success "What's new?"
    The public beta of our new product, [OCTO](https://octo.alphaus.cloud/en/octo), is now available!

    We've been working hard on this product for the past few months, and we're really excited to share it with you. We're still under development, but we've already received great feedback from our early beta testers.

    In the public beta, you'll have access to all of the features of OCTO, but there may be some bugs or limitations. We're committed to making OCTO the best it can be, so your feedback is essential.
