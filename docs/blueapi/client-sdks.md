# Client SDKs

We are in the process of generating client libraries (SDKs) for [programming languages supported in gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/). If you have a particular programming language in the list you want supported, contact us at support@alphaus.cloud and we will try to prioritize it.

## blue-sdk-go
Check out [here](https://github.com/alphauslabs/blue-sdk-go) for more information.

## blue-sdk-python
The Python SDK is now available via `pip`. Simply do:
``` sh
$ pip install alphausblue
```
and the Blue Python SDK, and all its dependencies will be installed. Examples can be found on our GitHub repo.
